Convene is as much a socioeconomic project as it is a technological one. It serves as a platform for designing, building and hosting web software applications that grant super-powers to mutual-aid and mutual benefit solidarity economy organizations.

Convene is deployed as a `Neighborhood` on commodity cloud infrastructure. It allows an `Operator`, (either a person or a worker and community-owned mutual-benefit technology cooperative) to support the digital operations of mutual-aid and mutual-benefit organizations (or `Neighbor`s).

Where `Contributors` labor to research, design, test, and build software that delights `Neighbor`s and grants them superpowers, `Operators` labor to distribute this software to `People`. `Operators`:

- Nurture the `Neighborhood` by setting and maintaining healthy boundaries between `People`, `Neighbor`s and other `Neighborhood`s.
- Welcome `People` to the `Neighborhood` and support them in becoming a good `Neighbor`.
- Help `Neighbor`s get the most from their `Neighborhood` through carework, gluework and technical support.

This guide covers the social, economic, and technological aspects of operating a Convene `Neighborhood`. Each section starts by describing the shared context, and then splitting between the three kinds of `Operator`s

- Worker-owned and Directed Cooperative, Mutual-Benefit, or Mutual Aid Organizations
- Individual People
- Legacy Organizations, such as traditional Non-profits, Governments, or Corporations
